# Welcome!

If you're here, we'd love to have you camp with us!

Here's a little bit about what we believe:
* We're passionate about creating gadgetry.
* We know and follow [the Ten Principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kDI2lCOEpo), plus one more.

...sound good? Good.

Let's walk you through what that means for us.

# Open Questions
- Are we a new camp or taking over an existing camp?

Things to consider:

>All new theme camps that have never been placed in Black Rock City before are capped at 100 x 100 ft or 10,000 square feet.
>If your camp has been placed as a theme camp before, the maximum size is 400 x 400 ft or 160,000 square feet

>Placement is ending the village designation as a placed camp category between 2024-25. Groups of people/camps can still call themselves a “village” in name, but will be treated as a single theme camp.

>If multiple camps are interested in sharing resources with other placed camps, you can form a hub instead. Please review our [HUBS](https://burningman.org/event/participate/camps/placement-process/hubs/) (Humans Uniting for Better Sustainability) FAQ page for more information.
