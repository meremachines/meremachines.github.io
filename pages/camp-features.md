For your own survival, you'll need to provide the rest. If it's your first time, we recommend reading the [Burning Man survival guide](https://survival.burningman.org/) and [our survival guide](./survival-guide).


## For the Playa


We are excited to provide the denizens of our fine land with:

* Interactive, novel, and interesting experiences with machines
* Food
* Drinks


## For the BMOrg

Next, it's time to learn about [how all that happens](communal-effort).
