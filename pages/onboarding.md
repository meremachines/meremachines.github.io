# Welcome to { site.title } !

If you're here, you're at least curious about what it's like to camp with us.

Here's a little bit about us:
* We're a camp that's passionate about creating gadgetry;
* We don't believe in sparkle ponies. On playa, build and strike are mandatory;
* Everyone needs to know and follow [the Ten Principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kDI2lCOEpo);

Sound good? Good. Read on.

* [Camp Features](./pages/camp-features.md) are what we provide for each other;
* [Black Rock City Contributions]() are what we provide for the playa;
* [Burning Man Organization Volunteering Efforts]() are what we provide for the org;
* [General Rules]() are our non-negotiable bylaws;
* [Roles]() outline the work you can expect to contribute should you choose to take on one or more positions in the camp heirarchy;
