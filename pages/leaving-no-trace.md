# Leaving No Trace
_Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our
activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible,
to leave such places in a better state than when we found them._

A lot of this is common sense, but common sense is not so common.

This includes basic things like:
* Putting things back in their home after you've used them. I can't count the number of times tasks have taken longer than expected because we've had to look for equipment someone else has used and moved.

* Cleaning camp dishes, pots, and pans after use, and storing them away from the elements
