# Leaving No Trace
_Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our
activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible,
to leave such places in a better state than when we found them._

A lot of this is common sense, but common sense is not so common.

This includes basic things like:
* Putting tools back in their home immediately after you've used them

* Cleaning camp dishes, pots, and pans after use, and storing them away from the elements
