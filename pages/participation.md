# Participation
_Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change,
whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation.
We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the
world real through actions that open the heart._

We don't believe in sparkle ponies; we believe everyone has something to offer.

We have several predefined roles to help people get started.
