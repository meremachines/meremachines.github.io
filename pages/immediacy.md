# Immediacy
_Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture.
We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality
of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers.
No idea can substitute for this experience._
