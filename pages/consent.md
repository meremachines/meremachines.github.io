# Consent
The Bureau of Erotic Discourse (B.E.D.) is integral to the Burning Man community, fostering a sex-positive environment while prioritizing consent and boundaries. Authentic consent, crucial for healthy interactions, embodies these key principles:

* Freely given: Voluntary consent without coercion or influence.
* Reversible: The right to withdraw consent at any time.
* Informed: Clear understanding of the agreement.
* Enthusiastic: Active willingness to engage.
* Specific: Clear boundaries established beforehand.
